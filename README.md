With marijuana legalization spreading across the Unites States, our hope is to empower people, young and old, to begin their growing hobby. We understand there is a plethora of information online that can sometimes be overwhelming and lead you in ten different directions. First Time Growers is here to filter through all the noise and provide our users with a simplified growing experience that is the result of our own personal trial and errors.
