Autoflowers don’t require seasonal signals to initiate flowering.Cannabis Ruderalis, a strain native to Russia, has the ability to flower despite consistent light and weather. This subspecies was crossed with Indica and Sativa to form hybrids that “automatically” flower after a set period of time. Hence the name, Autoflower.',

Photoperiods will stay in a Vegetative state as long as the lights are on for 18+ hours a day. Once you want them to start Flowering you switch the lights to a cycle of 12hours on, 12hours off.',

      info: 'When Autoflowers came on the the scene they were useful, but the yields were smaller because the plants spent less time in the Vegetative cycle (which builds the plants stems, leaves and overall size) they would produce lower yields due to there being less places for buds to grow (or to grow large). Nowadays that problem is almost non-existent as modern Autoflowers produce similar yields to their Photoperiod cousins. Obviously if you are growing in a very large medium or outdoors then Photoperiods will always produce more. ',
