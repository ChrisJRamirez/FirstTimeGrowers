     <p>So what is the difference between AutoFlowers and PhotoPeriod plants?</p>
     <p>We are happy you asked, the main difference is the amount of light required for each of thse plants to grow</p>
     <p>AutoFlowers will go through all the stages of their life-cycle regardless of hours of light, while PhotoPeriods
       require certain amounts of light to move beyond each cycle.
